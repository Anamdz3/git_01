## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

"Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,
   As he landed his crew with care;
Supporting each man on the top of the tide
   By a finger entwined in his hair.
Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

I have been one acquainted with the night.
I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.
I have outwalked the furthest city light.
I have looked down the saddest city lane.

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,
      Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright —
And this was odd, because it was
      The middle of the night.

The moon was shining sulkily,
      Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
      After the day was done —
"It's very rude of him," she said,
      "To come and spoil the fun."

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In halls where knowledge lights the way,
Future healers rise each day.
With steady hands and hearts so bold,
Their stories wait to be told.

A dream to heal, a path to fight,
For those in need, we shine our light.
Through books, through labs, through sleepless nights,
We chase the goal that feels so right.

But none succeed by strength alone,
It takes a village, hearts of stone.
Mentors, leaders, voices strong,
To guide us as we move along.

At LMSA, we stand as one,
A brighter future has begun.
For every student, every dream,
Together, we will build the team.
